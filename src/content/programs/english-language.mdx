# Digital Bridges for New Beginnings

NZEWT plays a vital role in facilitating the integration of new migrants and refugees through our computer literacy program. Our skilled team of instructors and interpreters work together to provide comprehensive computer skills training to individuals seeking to enhance their digital proficiency. By offering tailored lessons and personalized guidance, we empower participants to effectively use technology to navigate their new environment. Our program recognizes the importance of computer literacy in fostering social connections, pursuing educational opportunities, and securing employment. Through this initiative, NZEWT contributes to the empowerment of newcomers, enabling them to engage more fully in their communities and embrace the opportunities that lie ahead.
