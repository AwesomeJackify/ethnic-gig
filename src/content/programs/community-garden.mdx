# New Horizons Gardening Program

The "New Horizons Garden" initiative by NZ Ethnic Women Incorporated (NZEWT) plays a pivotal role in combating food shortages within the local community. By cultivating a diverse range of produce, including native New Zealand vegetables and fruits, as well as crops indigenous to African and Asian cultures, the garden fosters a sense of inclusivity. This approach ensures that the garden resonates with the broader community and appeals to its diverse cultural background. Notably, a portion of the harvested produce is made available for sale at the local Wesley Community Centre. Through this program, NZEWT not only addresses food scarcity but also nurtures cultural awareness and collaboration, fostering a more resilient and harmonious community.
