# New Horizons Community Garden

Welcome to New Horizons Community Garden, an organic oasis nestled in the heart of Mt Roskill. Our mission is to cultivate a healthy community and environment while promoting sustainable living.

## Our Mission

At New Horizons, we are passionate about celebrating the cultural richness of food, plants, and people within our community garden, especially among migrant and refugee communities. We achieve this by offering workshops and training sessions on the art of growing food. These activities harness the collective knowledge and skills of farming, enabling participants to gain insights into gardening specific to New Zealand. By empowering migrant and refugee communities with these valuable skills, we not only contribute to their physical well-being but also facilitate socialization and the formation of a support network that can be invaluable in the future.

## Location

**Where:** John Moore Reserve, 22 Bremner Ave, Mt Roskill
