# Nourish and Care Delivery Service

NZEWT operates a vital food and hygiene delivery program that initially began as a response to the COVID pandemic. Originally intended to aid COVID-positive individuals who couldn't access supermarkets, our program entailed delivering fresh food, essential hygiene products, and even hot meals. While the COVID situation has improved, the program continues to serve a crucial purpose by now focusing on vulnerable families.
Recognizing ongoing needs within our community, we have transitioned to supporting families facing vulnerabilities. By providing essential sustenance and hygiene products, we aim to alleviate the challenges that vulnerable households might encounter. This program underscores our commitment to compassionately addressing evolving needs and fostering resilience within our community.
