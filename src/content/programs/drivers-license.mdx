# Get Set and Drive

NZEWT collaborates with the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to deliver a comprehensive drivers license program. This initiative facilitates the acquisition of learners, restricted, and full licenses, empowering individuals within our community to access increased mobility and employment opportunities. Through partnerships with registered tutors, we offer hands-on, practical driving instruction, ensuring participants receive expert guidance throughout their learning journey. Recognizing the diverse linguistic needs of our community, we go the extra mile by providing customized lessons supported by language interpreters when required. By removing barriers and tailoring our approach, NZEWT's drivers license program aims to enhance personal independence, open doors to employment prospects, and promote safer road practices among our community members.
