# NCEA Success

In conjunction with the Ministry of Education (MOE), NZEWT administers an invaluable NCEA tutoring program, tailored specifically for high school students. Geared towards those navigating NCEA levels 1 through 3, this initiative offers personalized guidance to teens facing the challenges of their academic journey. Our dedicated team of teachers and tutors plays a pivotal role in providing comprehensive support across various aspects of the NCEA curriculum. Whether it's assignments, tests, or exams, our program is designed to address the unique needs of each student, ensuring a solid grasp of the material and bolstering their academic progress. By joining forces with MOE, NZEWT aims to equip high school students with the resources and guidance necessary to excel in their NCEA studies. Through this program, we foster a culture of learning, growth, and achievement among the youth, contributing to their overall educational success.
