# Sewing Class for Migrant & Refugee Women

NZEWT operates a sewing school program aimed at empowering the community. Held at both the Wesley Community Centre and Waterview Community Centre, this initiative is designed to cater to various skill levels, ranging from beginners to advanced participants. By nurturing sewing talents and honing skills, the program not only fosters creative expression but also prepares individuals for potential future employment opportunities in the field. Through hands-on instruction and skill development, our sewing school equips participants with valuable expertise, enabling them to explore promising prospects in the world of sewing and design.
