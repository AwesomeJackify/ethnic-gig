# Sewing Class for Migrant & Refugee Women

***6 Months Course***

Join us for an enriching sewing experience at the Ethnic Hub, located at 190 Stoddard Road, Mt Roskill. Our sewing courses offer a wonderful opportunity for migrant and refugee women to engage in meaningful activities, nurture their creativity, boost their energy, and enhance their life skills.

## Sewing Circle

The **Sewing Circle** is designed for individuals with no prior sewing experience. It provides a welcoming environment for learning to sew using domestic sewing machines while fostering connections among women from diverse ethnic backgrounds. This course is self-paced and accommodates participants of all skill levels.

## Sewing School

Our **Sewing School** is a free program that operates during the school terms. It offers two distinct courses:

1. **Beginners Sewing Course**: Ideal for those new to sewing, this course spans six months and provides a strong foundation. Students learn on industrial sewing machines, setting the stage for further training and potential employment in the clothing operations sector.

2. **Advanced Sewing Course**: Geared towards individuals with prior sewing experience, this six-month course allows students to refine their skills under the guidance of our expert instructors.

Learning to sew is a lifelong skill, and our students attend classes five days a week during the term:

- **Monday - Wednesday**
  - *Beginners*: 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM
  - *Level 1*: 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM
