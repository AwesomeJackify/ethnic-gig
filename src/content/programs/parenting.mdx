# Nurturing Generations

NZEWT's SKIP Program extends valuable support to parents from migrant and refugee backgrounds. This initiative is designed to blend New Zealand parenting methods with the cultural values from their countries of origin, ensuring a balanced approach to raising children.
Our primary objective with this program is to cultivate a harmonious fusion of customs and cultures from both New Zealand and the parents' homelands. Our focus stems from the belief that while adapting to a new country is crucial, preserving the richness of one's heritage is equally vital. We are dedicated to empowering parents to instill an understanding of New Zealand culture while nurturing a strong connection to their roots for their children.
Central to our approach is the creation of customized values for each parent, fostering a parenting style that aligns with their individual circumstances. Through collaborative efforts, we mold a parenting approach that caters to the unique needs and aspirations of each of our clients.
