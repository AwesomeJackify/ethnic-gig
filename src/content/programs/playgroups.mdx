# Welcome to Our Playgroup

Our playgroup warmly welcomes all parents with children under 6 years to join us. Our primary goal is to provide a friendly and inclusive space for parents and young children to connect regularly. Led by parents, our playgroup is dedicated to offering a variety of educational activities that support children's learning and development, aligned with the NZ Early Childhood Education (ECE) curriculum, Te Whariki.

We create age-appropriate play and social opportunities for babies, toddlers, and young children. Our methods focus on enhancing language skills, early literacy, physical development, social interaction, and emotional growth. Families in our playgroup also receive guidance and encouragement to engage with local early childhood services, and we assist parents and children with their transition to kindergarten and school. All our playgroups are free of charge and led by trained and experienced bilingual playgroup leaders.

We provide numerous opportunities for children to improve their literacy and numeracy, promote healthy eating habits, and explore arts and crafts.

Our multilingual playgroup offers a fun way for children to celebrate and preserve their cultural heritage, all while having a great time. Parents can also learn alongside their children, make new friends, and adapt to life in New Zealand.
