# Welcome to our Playgroup

NZEWT's dynamic playgroup program is tailored to the needs of children under 6, providing a stimulating afterschool experience. Led by skilled bilingual playgroup leaders, these sessions offer an engaging environment for babies, toddlers, and young children to engage in purposeful play and build valuable social connections. Beyond play, our program emphasizes language development, early literacy, and emotional growth, contributing to well-rounded development.
Recognizing the significance of family involvement, our program assists parents in connecting with local early childhood services, ensuring a smooth transition to kindergarten and school. This comprehensive approach establishes a solid foundation for each child's educational journey.
