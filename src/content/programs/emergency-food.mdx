# Rapid Response Flood Relief

In the aftermath of the Auckland flood, NZEWT took immediate action by initiating an emergency flood relief program. Collaborating with May Rd School, a local primary school, we offered critical assistance to affected families. Recognizing the urgency, we provided emergency housing within the school's hall for a limited duration, offering a safe haven during a challenging time. Our efforts extended beyond shelter, encompassing provisions for families in need. We organized food deliveries to ensure sustenance, and additionally, we procured essential household items including appliances, furniture, and bedding, effectively contributing to the restoration of their living conditions. Through this partnership-driven relief program, NZEWT exhibited our dedication to supporting the community during times of crisis, showcasing our commitment to swift and comprehensive aid for families affected by natural disasters.
