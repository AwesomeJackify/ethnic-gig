# NZEWT After-School Program

NZEWT collaborates with the Ministry of Education (MOE) to offer a dynamic after-school program tailored to primary and middle school students. This initiative focuses on assisting children with their homework and assignments, delivering personalized support through a dedicated team of teachers and volunteers. Our program aims to enhance the educational journey of students by providing targeted assistance in areas where they may require additional guidance. The team's combined efforts ensure that each child receives customized, one-on-one help, fostering a deeper understanding of subjects and promoting academic success. Through this partnership with MOE, NZEWT is committed to empowering young learners, building their confidence, and creating a supportive environment where their educational needs are met beyond the regular school hours.
