# NZEWT After-School Program

Welcome to NZEWT's After-School Program, a nurturing space that brings together refugee kids from all corners of Auckland City, providing them with a safe environment to learn, grow, and thrive.

## Our Mission

Our project is dedicated to serving refugee youth and young humanitarian migrants hailing from diverse backgrounds, including Somalia, Eritrea, Syria, Sudan, Myanmar, Afghanistan, and Iraq. We cater to children between the ages of 5 to 15, spanning from year 1 through year 10, who are currently enrolled in school. Our primary focus is on students who have been in New Zealand for three years or less, with special attention given to those who have resided in Auckland for less than one year.

## Program Services

Our comprehensive program offers a range of services to empower and uplift young minds:
- **Nutritious Meals:** We begin with a hearty meal to fuel the students for their activities.
- **Homework Assistance:** Dedicated volunteers work alongside the students to help them complete their assignments.
- **English Language Practice:** Students engage in English language practice sessions to enhance their language skills.
- **Basic Skills Review:** We provide support for students to strengthen their fundamental skills.
- **Kiwi Culture:** Our program includes lessons on Kiwi culture, helping students integrate into their new community.
- **Holiday Fun:** During school holidays, we organize a variety of enjoyable activities for the students to partake in.

## Program Leadership

The After-School program is led by a passionate group of volunteers who are committed to making a difference. Our team also includes a highly experienced high school teacher with years of expertise in educating children of various age groups. Additionally, we have specialized teachers who visit once a week to facilitate art and cultural activities. Our staff is bilingual, which fosters inclusivity and enables us to embrace the rich tapestry of cultures within our safe and welcoming environment.

Join us in supporting the educational and cultural growth of these exceptional young individuals. Together, we create a brighter future!
